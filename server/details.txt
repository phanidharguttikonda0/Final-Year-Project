Application back-end design :

https://localhost:xxxx/sign-in  [Studio Sync] or [Core Create]

https://localhost:xxxx/sign-up [Studio Setup] or [Core Connect] the word we are going to use for the sign-up

https://localhost:xxxx/get-history

https://localhost:xxxx/get-history-item  [returns the item of the history clicked]

https://localhost:xxxx/post-history  [sends the prompt and the out-put of the ai model ] doesn’t sends the pdf file

each document should contain

[
    {

        email ,

        password,

        mobile,

        chats-history: [

            chat-1: [  { prompt: “”, model-used: "", out-put: “”} , ....       ]

            ....

            ],
        chats: [
            chat-1: srs.pdf,
            ....
        ]

    }
]

we are going to use the mongo db for this

For a Chat we are going to allow only upload one SRS document and the we can allow multiple prompts
